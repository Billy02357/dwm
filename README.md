# Running dwm

If you do not use a login manager (such as lightdm) then you can add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm
	
If you use a login manager (like lightdm), make sure that you have a file called dwm.desktop in your /usr/share/xsessions/ directory.  It should look something like this:

	[Desktop Entry]
	Encoding=UTF-8
	Name=Dwm
	Comment=Dynamic window manager
	Exec=dwm
	Icon=dwm
	Type=XSession
